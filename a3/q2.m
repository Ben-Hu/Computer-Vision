%% Assignment 3 Q2

% Given K r and T, we can compute P, the projective transform 
% where q = P[x,y,z,1]
% we take points q1 and q2 and given we have P we can find x,y,z,1 for
% those points in the real world
% x will be fixed, we can assume y will be fixed at 0 (no changes in
% elevation for the railway tracks so the difference between the computed z
% distances will be the distance between the railway tracks
% Lecture 10

%P^-1 * [x,y] = [x,y,z]
